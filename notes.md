# Deployment Notes

# Jargon

Single Responsibility Principle:
    - a specific unit of work should do only one thing, and it should do that one thing really well. (only one reason to change)

# Deployment

- extract configuration into environment variables
- setup continuous deployment from Github to Heroku
